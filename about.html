      especially excellent raiders. If you're interested in joining us, please
      message Glx, Euphadion or Alexithym√¨a in game!

    <h2>Raid Times</h2>

    <h2>Loot System</h2>
    <p><strong>EPGP (DKP Reloaded)</strong>
      <br>
      Sounds complicated, but essentially it's a ratio
      of effort put in over gear obtained that determines your priority for
      loot drops. That being said, if it helps the raid as a whole, more often
      than not if it's a good piece for you, we'll put gear where it matters
      the most!</p>
