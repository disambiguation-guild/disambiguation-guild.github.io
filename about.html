    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Disambiguation is close-knit group of Mythic raiders who have fun, work
      hard, and always help each other out. We welcome new players,
      especially excellent raiders. If you're interested in joining us, please
      message Glx, Euphadion or Alexithym√¨a in game!
    </p>

    <h2>Raid Times</h2>
    <p>
      All raids run from 9PM-12AM Pacific Standard Time
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tuesdays</strong>
      <br>
      Optional/farm night! This is where we do our heroic/mythic
      farm clear, have a couple of drinks,
      and gamble all of our gold away to each other.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Wednesdays</strong>
      <br>
      Clear night, early progression; a trend in this guild is once
      we've killed a boss once, we never ever have trouble with it again - this
      means that all Mythic bosses previously cleared can be pushed to Wednesday
      to (hopefully) get some crucial upgrades on raiders in order to push hard
      on progression fights.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Thursdays</strong>
      <br>
      Hardcore progression nights! Don't let the name scare you,
      this is where the fun happens, and where the satisfaction of the kill
      gives you a high you just can't compete with anywhere else.</p>
    <h2>Loot System</h2>
    <p><strong>EPGP (DKP Reloaded)</strong>
      <br>
      Sounds complicated, but essentially it's a ratio
      of effort put in over gear obtained that determines your priority for
      loot drops. That being said, if it helps the raid as a whole, more often
      than not if it's a good piece for you, we'll put gear where it matters
      the most!</p>
