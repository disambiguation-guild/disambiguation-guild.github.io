# contributions to site
1. Ask Julep for to get added to github repo
2. You'll want to pull down the repo then create a personalized branch in order to create PRs for edits so that we can have a CR.
3. Make sure to "git pull origin master" to resolve any potential conflicts before making changes. Very important.
4. Other than that go wild, have fun and let's keep these as updates to the content of the site to get current data up. If you're making major structural changes contact Julep to let her know so that she can take a bit of a deeper dive.
5. The style of the site has been established, so not really necessary to mess with a good thing!
